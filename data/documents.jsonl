I will continue these actions until I receive an apology from this story or until I get some backing.. This McDonald's restaurant continues to mistreat the poor and destitute. 1) requiring some to take their food to go 2) some they charge for a restroom token even after they paid for food and or drink 3) 30 minute time limit for the ones they choose to alow to eat in ONLY ENFORCED FOR THE POOR. 4) will not ask \"for here or to go\""}

We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews. I am hoping that they were just short-staffed the night we went."}
